Employment Opportunities
============================================

CNERG is frequently seeking additional group members at all levels to
assist us in our mission of delivering new computing capability for
the analysis of nuclear energy systems.

While each position will require specialized skills to fulfill that
role, staff and students at all levels will be expected to be
proficient with the basic tools of robust software development.  We
often refer to these skills collectively as `Software Carpentry`_.
