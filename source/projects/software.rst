Software Distribution
=======================

One of the missions of CNERG is to publish software for the analysis of nuclear systems.

* `Svalinn <http://github.com/svalinn>`_ is a collection of tools based around the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo toolkit.
    * `Direct Acclerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) </DAGMC>`_ is a toolkit for perfomring efficient Monte Carlo geometry queries on CAD-based geometries.
* `Cyclus <http://cyclus.github.com>`_ is an open-source agent-based platform for analyzing nuclear fuel cycles.
* `DataTransferKit <http://cnerg.github.com/DataTransferKit>`_ provides parallel mesh searching and field mapping services for arbitrary physics codes based on the concept of geometric rendezevous.
