Welcome to CNERG
=================

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group focuses on the
nuclear design and analysis of nuclear energy systems and fuel cycle
concepts. While research activities include methods development and
methodology integration, it is generally in support of improving the
ability to perform nuclear analyses of engineering systems. As nuclear
analysts, CNERGâ€™s strengths are in modeling radiation transport and
nuclide inventory changes.
