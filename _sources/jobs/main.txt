Employment Opportunities
============================================

CNERG is frequently seeking additional group members at all levels to
assist us in our mission of delivering new computing capability for
the analysis of nuclear energy systems.

While each position will require specialized skills to fulfill that
role, staff and students at all levels will be expected to be
proficient with the basic tools of robust software development.  We
often refer to these skills collectively as `Software Carpentry`_.

Fall 2013 Graduate Student Opportunities
-----------------------------------------

CNERG is planning to add 2-4 new graduate students in the Fall 2013
semester with projects in the general areas identified below.  All of
these tasks will require programming and software development and
students with demonstrated experience with `Software Carpentry`_
skills will be preferred.  Prospective students are encouraged to
`apply for graduate study in our department
<http://www.grad.wisc.edu/education/admissions/>`_ and draw specific
attention to these topics, indiciating what unique knowledge or
experiences they will bring to these tasks.


* **Robust workflows for CAD-based Monte Carlo radiation transport**
  This will require understanding of computational geometry, mesh
  generation, and manipulation of mesh to improve the robustness of
  analysis workflows to imperfections in the geometry or the geometry
  processing steps.

* **Adaptivity for Advanced Monte Carlo Mesh Tallies** Thsi will
  investigate the trade-off between mesh resolution, solution fidelity
  and statistical error, relying on a combination of nuclear
  engineering and applied math.

* **Variance Reduction in Complex 3-D Geometries** This will extend
  our collaboration with ORNL on their CADIS/FW-CADIS methods, but
  applying them to CAD-based geometries and consideration of complex
  source distributions, using knowledge of nuclear engineering with
  some applied math.

* **Scalable mixed mesh data transfer** This will extend the existing
  capability of the DataTransferKit to support surface-surface
  transfer, using a combination of applied math and computational
  geometry knowledge.

* **Socioeconomic Metrics for Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles** This will
  develop software algorithms to convert fundamental fuel cycle
  simulation results into quantities that are relevant for
  socioeconomic assessment of those fuel cycles.
