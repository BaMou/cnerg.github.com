CNERG Philosophy
================

Mission
+++++++

Build a `welcoming community`_ that fosters the `professional and personal
growth`_ of new generations of scientists who develop `advanced computational
tools`_ that deepen our understanding of the peaceful uses of `nuclear science
and technology`_.


Welcoming Community
-------------------

The CNERG community should be welcoming to all who seek to contribute to its
`mission`_.  This begins with a collective commitment to the
:doc:`code of conduct <conduct>`.

We all do our best work when we feel respected by our peers and our
contributions are valued.  Every member of CNERG is responsible for creating
this environment of mutual respect and value.  The group is made up of
individuals with a wide range of personal and educational histories and goals.
Being sensitive to these differences is an important part of your professional
development.
 
Fostering a sense of community requires regular interaction and individual
investment in that community.  The simplest way to contribute is by attending
group meetings and spending time in your office during common hours.  The
combination of formal and informal interactions that results from these two
simple steps creates a sense of familiarity that will directly contribute to
our combined success.

     
Nuclear Science and Technology
------------------------------

The defining characteristic of CNERG research is the physics of nuclear
reactions and the radiation that they produce.  This puts our work at the
heart of nuclear engineering, with specific topics that are both central and
unique to the discipline.


Advanced Computational Tools
----------------------------

While there may be diversity among the projects being pursued within CNERG, a
common thread is a desire to improve the understanding of nuclear energy
systems.  This leads to a research philosophy that puts us on the boundary
between methods development and systems analysis, delivering real analysis
capability.  Where some research groups focus on theoretical methods
development with little regard for realistic problems, and others focus on
using other people’s computational tools to analyze systems, we focus on
delivering new capability to analyze real systems.  This can include the
development of new methods and often requires the analysis of real systems to
test the delivered capability, but CNERG’s strength is in delivering robust
tools that extend the types of analysis that are available for nuclear energy
systems.  A key outcome of this philosophy is a strong reliance on skills
associated with software engineering, and the development of such skill sets
among CNERG members.


Professional and Personal Growth
--------------------------------

As an academic research group, the growth of all members of CNERG is an
important facet of our `mission`_.  While such growth should be possible in
many work places, it has a defining role in ours.  For some, this includes
their formal education as a student of the `University of Wisconsin`_.

Healthy Environment
-------------------

A healthy physical, intellectual and emotional environment is a pre-requisite
to everyone's success.  

* necessary for success
* limitations of physical environment
* supportive emotional and intellectual environment
