'''Thesis topic'''   
    

Enhancing the reliability and efficiency of the hybrid Monte Carlo/deterministic neutronics modeling techniques for the full scale shielding calculations of large and complicated systems. Four algorithms are being developed and implemented in production-level codes for:

 * Improving accuracy of deterministic calculations with minor impact on efficeincy of overall simulation:
Macromaterials approach (added to SCALE 6.1 and ORNL code ADVANTG)
Adaptive deterministic mesh refinement (being added to ADVANTG)

 * Improving weight-window mesh of Monte Carlo simulations: 
Adjoint flux collapsing (being added to ADVANTG) 
Weight-window coarsening (being added to ADVANTG)

'''Global neutronics modeling of the ITER fusion reactor'''   
----   

The ability of performing global Monte Carlo calculations for nuclear parameters throughout the entire ITER reactor was demonstrated using the hybrid Monte Carlo/deterministic techniques CADIS and FW-CADIS and the applicability of coupling these techniques with CAD based Monte Carlo methods were demonstrated. Results are published in two journal papers and several conference summaries.

'''Assessing performance of hybrid Monte Carlo/deterministic methods for criticality (eigenvalue) simulations'''   
----   
The potential benefits and limitations of several hybrid approaches for improving the performance of Monte Carlo eigenvalue calculations are being investigated. Preliminarily results are being published in two conference summaries.

'''Previous research at University of Wisconsin-Madison'''   
  

'''Fusion Development Facility (FDF) neutronics analysis'''   
----  
Neutronics analysis was performed for the baseline design of the FDF. FDF CAD model was used to perform three dimensional neutronics using the DAG-MCNP. Findings important to the FDF design was published in a journal paper.

'''High Average Power Laser (HAPL) final optics and shielding configuration'''   
----  
A three-dimensional CAD model was developed for the HAPL system and neutronics calculations were performed to assess the impact of the GIMM design options on the nuclear environment at the dielectric focusing and turning mirrors.  The impact of the biological shielding configuration on the nuclear environment at the GIMM and dielectric focusing and turning mirrors was also assessed with several variations of this model. Results were published in several journal papers and conference summaries.


'''Neutrons streaming via cooling pipes in the ARIES compact stellarator'''   
----  

Two and three- dimensional analysis were performed using the deterministic transport codes DANTSYS and Attila respectively. The three dimensional CAD model was developed using the Sandia national laboratory tool CUBIT. The three dimensional analysis showed the applicability of Attila to perform neutronics analysis of complex fusion systems and in particular the problem of radiation streaming. The analysis likewise showed that Attila cannot be used as a black box. Thought must be given to the generation of a workable CAD model using experiences gained from discrete ordinates codes before importing it into Attila. Results were published in a journal paper and several conference summaries.
